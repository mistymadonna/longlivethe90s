A few weeks ago, I finished Ariana Huffington's book, The Sleep Revolution, and it hammered in my head that I was correct in thinking I wasn't getting enough sleep.

Eliminating blue light from phones, exercising, and no sugar before bed are things most of know, but she took it a step further to explain why with science.

The book recommends that adults (ages 26-64) should get 7-9 hours of sleep, with women needing a little more sleep than men. The best sleeping temperature is at 60-66 degrees Fahrenheit (brown fat activation starts at 66 degrees, so this is a double win).

Other tips include turning down the lights a few hours before going to bed, exercising 50 mins moderately weekly, eating cherries because they're rich in melatonin, and eating foods high in magnesium.

Acupuncture and meditation also help in getting quality sleep according to the book.

The Sleep Revolution pleasantly surprised me with the amount of data and research is included.

I highly recommend it if you're struggling with sleep.
