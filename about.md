I'm Misty.
This is a moving, visual diary of my life in Seattle.
I'm a software engineer. I started out in front-end web and mobile development but for the last few years I've been back-end, writing mostly in Go. I'm originally from Nashville and in my free time, I love reading, building bots, helping people, neuroscience, and computer science/hacking weird stuff. :)
